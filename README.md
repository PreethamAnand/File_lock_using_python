# Python
Project made using python language
<br>
To use this file, fisrt we need to save it at our desired location.
<br>
We have to set out "LOCKER_PASSWORD" in the code so that when we run the .py file we need to enter the password.
<br>
If the password matches with the in file password the we will be having chance to select a file for which we are thinking to add the privacy lock.
<br>
Same as we place the lock smilarly we can also unlock the folder by entering the pin then then select unlock file option and select the locked file.
<br>
THIS LOCKING SYSTEM IS ONLY APPLICABLE FOR FILES NOT FOR FOLDERS.
